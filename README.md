microRTS is a small implementation of an RTS game, designed to perform AI research. The advantage of using microRTS with respect to using a full-fledged game like Wargus or Starcraft (using BWAPI) is that microRTS is much simpler, and can be used to quickly test theoretical ideas, before moving on to full-fledged RTS games.

microRTS is deterministic and real-time (i.e. players can issue actions simultaneously, and actions are durative). It is possible to experiment both with fully-observable and partially-observable games. Thus, it is not adequate for evaluating AI techniques designed to deal with non-determinism (although future versions of microRTS might include non-determinism activated via certain flags). As part of the implementation, I include a collection of hard-coded, and game-tree search techniques (such as variants of minimax, Monte Carlo search, and Monte Carlo Tree Search).

microRTS was developed by [Santiago Onta침칩n](https://sites.google.com/site/santiagoontanonvillar/Home). 

For a video of how microRTS looks like when a human plays see a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsKKAoiD7B0)

If you are interested in testing your algorithms against other people's, **there is an annual microRTS competition**. For more information on the competition see the [competition website](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/home). The previous competitions have been organized at IEEE-CIG2017 and IEEE-CIG2018, and this year it's organized at IEEE-COG2019 (notice the change of name of the conference).

The LSI AI was contributed by Alexander Shleyfman, Antonin Komenda and Carmel Domshlak (the theory behind the AI is described in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282075129_On_Combinatorial_Actions_and_CMABs_with_Linear_Side_Information).

## How to run programmatically

To play the game with mouse to test it out, please check

```
java -classpath "microrts.jar;./lib/*" tests.PlayGameWithMouseTest
```

To run experiments, please try the following

```
java -classpath "microrts.jar" tests.sockets.RunClientLayersSmall

nohup java -cp microrts.jar tests.sockets.RunClient --server-port 9899 > my.log 2>&1 &

NUM_CORES=5
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=$NUM_CORES OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NUM_CORES
nohup python stable_A2C.py >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```
